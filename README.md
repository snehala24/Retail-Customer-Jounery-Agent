## Problem  
Customers experience fragmented journeys across online, mobile, messaging, and in-store shopping channels. This leads to missed upsell/cross-sell opportunities and inconsistent support. The goal is to design an **AI-driven Conversational Sales Agent** that ensures seamless, personalized, omnichannel shopping to boost Average Order Value (AOV) and conversion rates.
